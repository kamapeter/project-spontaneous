        <h1>What is a Force?</h1>
        <div class="main">
          <p>Force is basically a push or a pull. 300 years ago after making thorough
            observations, Isaac Newton put forth his conclusions in the laws of
            motion. From the first law of motion we can derive a comprehensive
            definition of force.</p>
          <p>The law states:
            <blockquote>
              <span class="law">"Every body will continue in it's present state of rest or continue
                moving in a straight line with uniform speed unless a force acts
                on it".</span>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>This means that:
            <em>When stationary bodies begin to move a force must be acting on them
              and when moving bodies stop moving or change their speed,a force
              is also acting on them.</em> The following animations illustrate
            this:</p>

        <h1>INERTIA</h1>
        <div class="main">
          <p>
            <strong>Inertia</strong> refers to the tendency of a body to remain in its
            state of rest or uniform motion.</p>
          <p>In other words inertia is responsible for stationary bodies remaining
            stationary and moving bodies remaining in motion. Since Newton first
            law is similar to the above statement, it is also known as the law
            of inertia.</p>
          <p>Bigger bodies have bigger inertia in other words as the mass of a body
            increases its inertia also increases, hence more force is required
            to move a truck (big body) than a bicycle(small body) because the truck
            has more inertia than the bicycle. Conversely more force is required
            to stop a moving truck than a moving bike</p>

        <h1>Inertia</h1>
        <div class="main">
          <p>We experience the effect of inertia in everyday life. For example when
            a fast moving car suddenly comes to rest,its passengers jerk forward.
            Why? The concept of inertia explains this: when the car was in motion
            its passengers where also moving they possess inertia and would therefore
            tend to continue to move hence they jerked forward. This can lead to
            serious accidents hence seat belts are provided to reduce the effect
            of inertia.</p>
          <p>Naturally once bodies begin to move they should continue moving infinitely
            but this is not always the case because other forces such as gravity,
            friction and air resistance acts to resist their motion thereby changing
            it (stopping or reducing) just as predicted by Newtons first law.</p>

        <h1>Momentum</h1>
        <div class="main">
          <p>In order to fully understand forces we must consider a second quantity
            called "
            <strong>Momentum</strong>".</p>
          <p>Momentum is defined mathematically
            <em> as the product of mass and velocity.</em> That is mass×velocity.</p>
          <p>It is usually denoted by P. therefore:
            <h3 class="law">P = m × v</h4>
              The unit of Momentum is Kgms<sup>-1</sup> or Ns. We would shortly
              explain the last unit.</p>
          <p>Hence if a body has a mass of 10kg and a velocity of ms<sup>-1</sup>,
            its momentum is:
            <br> P = m × v
            <br> P=10kg×5ms
            <sup>-1</sup>
            <br> P=50Kgms
            <sup>-1</sup> or 50Ns</p>

          The direct consequence of the definition of momentum is that,Bigger bodies have
          more momentum than smaller bodies when they move with they move with
          the same velocity.
          <p>This explains why a large truck has more destructive effect on objects
            it hits than a small car even when they move with same speed.</p>

          Newton's second law helps us to quantitatively define force.
          <p>It states that:

              to the applied force and takes place in its direction".</span>

            <em> When there is a greater change in the momentum of a body, a great force
              is acting on it. But when the change in momentum is small,it is because
              a small force is acting on it.</em>

        <h1 class="LearnH">Net Forces</h1>
        <h1>Net Force</h1>
        <div class="main">
          <p>In most cases more than one force acts on a body. In that case, the total
            effect of those forces on a body is known as the
            <strong>Net Force</strong>. Forces are vector quantities thus they have both
            direction and magnitude. So the effect of the forces acting on a body
            depend on their respective magnitude and direction. The net force has
            the same effect as the original Forces acting on it. For example if
            two boys pull a toy in opposite direction with a force of 5N each.
            The resultant force is :
            <br> F = 5N +(-5N) = 0.
            <br> Or we say no net force acts on the toy. 0N can replace the forces
            acting on it. This explains why the body does not accelerate.</p>
          <p>
            If on the on the other hand the two boys push the toy with a force of 5N each facing
            the same direction, the net Force is
            <br> F = 5N + 5N = 10N
            <br> 10N can replace the two forces acting on the toy and produce the same
            effect. This explains why a greater acceleration is produced.
          </p>
          <p>Hence Newton's Second Law can be correctly restated as :
            <blockquote>
              <span class="law">If a net external force act on a body it Accelerates in the direction
                of the Net Force</span>.</blockquote>
          </p>
          hence
          <h4 class="law">F = ma</h4>
          where F is the net force,m the mass and a the acceleration

          From Newton's second law,it is clear that the total force acting on bodies moving
          with constant speed is zero.
          <br> F=ma when a=0 => F=0
          <br> For example the car in the first animation below moves with an acceleration
          of 20m<sup>-1</sup> throughout the whole journey hence the total force
          acting on it zero while the velocity of the second body increases from
          10ms<sup>-1</sup> to 20ms<sup>-1</sup>. If the journey lasted for two
          seconds the total force acting on the body is:
          <br> F=ma
          <br> but a=(v-u)/t

        <h1>Newton's Third Law of Motion</h1>
        <div class="main">
          <p>Newton third law of motion helps us to understand a fundamental characteristic
            of force.</p>
          <p>It States that:
            <span class="law">For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</span>
          </p>
          <p>What this means:
            <em>when a force acts on a body (this is an action) the body exerts another
              force. (this is the reaction) The magnitude of the reaction is equal
              to the action but its direction is opposite that of the action</em>

        <h1>Newton's Third Law</h1>
        <div class="main">
          <p>We experience the effects of newton's third law everyday for example:</p>
          <p>When you stand on the ground you exert a force known as weight on the
            ground and the earth in turn exerts an upward force equal to your weight
            on you(reaction force) just as in the diagram below.</p>
          <p>Similarly, when a car moves the engine exerts a forward force on it.
            just as precdicted by newtons second law,this 'forward' force is countered
            by other resistive 'backward' force which may include friction and
            air resistance. In the future you'll learn about suvh forces</p>
