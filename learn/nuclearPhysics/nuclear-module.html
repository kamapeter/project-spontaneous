        <h1>Concept Of Atom</h1>
        <div class="main">
          If you take an object, say a yam and keep dividing it with a knife,the particles
          of the yam would logically become smaller with each division. Ultimately
          a point would be reached where further division would be impossible.
          Yes we would have reached the
          <strong>Smallest Constituent</strong> of the object (yam). This is what we call
          an Atom.
          <p>Basically an Atom is :
            <em>
              <span class="law">
                A basic building block of matter
              </span>
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>But what does an atom "look like"? how does it behave? what is it composition?
            You'll learn about this in subsequent modules. This module was just
            to remind you of what you've learnt before</p>

        <h1>Models</h1>
        <div class="main">
          In subsequent modules we'll be talking majorly on models so it'll be Nice if you
          grok what the really are.
          <p> A model is
            <em> A simplified representation used to explain the working of some real
              world object or system</em>
          </p>
          <p> So basically a model need not be exactly like the object it explains
            it just needs to explain the real world object consistently. An example
            of a model would be using stones to teach a child how to calculate
            sums of money. The stones are not exactly money but can be used to
            represent money thus making it easy for the child to sum up amounts
            of money. The child can easily add up stones and count. Hence the stones
            are models of a real world object—money.</p>
          <p>In physics, we can't always comprehend all the workings nature hence
            we use models— things we can easily visualize to explain them. the
            models need not have a true resemblance of the real world object, They
            just need to explain them consistently </p>

        <h1>Thompson's Model of the Atom</h1>
        <div class="main">
          <strong>Basis:</strong>In 1897 J.J Thomson based on his experiments discovered
          that atoms contain negatively charged particles called electrons.
          <br>
          <br> He also measured their mass to charge ratio which indicated they were
          very tiny.
          <br>
          <br> In a bid to explain his findings, Thomson proposed a model of the atom
          known as the "Plum Pudding Model".
          <p>He proposed that the atom is:
            <li>A sphere of positive charge with negative charges (electrons) surrounding
              it.</li>
            <li> The magnitude of the positive charge is equal to the magnitude of the
              negative charges hence the atom is electrically neutral (positive
              and negative neutralize).</li>
          </p>
          <p>Thus Thomson's model explains why the atom could contain negative charge
            and still remain electrically neutral.</p>

          As was true of other early models of the atom,thomson's model had to be dropped
          because it could not consistently explain new experimental discoveries.
          In fact we only considered it here because of its historic importance.
          <p>In view of this other theories/models had to be developed in other to
            explain new experimental discoveries. In the next module we will discuss
            one of this models.</p>

          what made the alpha particles recoil? Rutherford proposed a model that explained
          this "strange behaviour", viz:
          <li>The atom is mostly empty space with a small positive nucleus.</li>
          <li>Electrons revolve around the nucleus (just like planets do around the
            sun).</li>
          <br>
          <br> This model explains why some of the particles penetrated (the atom is
          mostly empty space) and why some recoiled (they are repelled by positive
          nucleus).
          <br> It also proposed that the positive nucleus compels the electrons to
          revolve around nucleus.

        <h1>Rutherford's Model</h1>
        <div class="main">
          Rutherford's model of the atom is not without it's limitatotions.
          <br> According to a proven electromagnetic theory, any accelerating charge
          emits radiation and hence it's energy reduces.
          <br> According to thomson's model electrons revolve around the nucleus and
          hence emits radiation. The kind of radiation observed was of the line
          spectrum (single momentary emmissions) but that predicted by thomson's
          model was of the continous spectrum (series of emissions) because the
          electrons were continually moving and the frequency of radiation depends
          on the frequency of revolution of the electrons.
          <br>Another consequence of thomson's model was that the electrons would continue
          to loose energy (since the emit it) and would ultimately collapse into
          the nucleus. So why should an atom exist? clearly a new model was needed...

        <h1>Bohr's model of the Atom</h1>
        <div class="main">
          <strong>Basis:</strong>
          Niels bohr proposed a model of the atom in 1913 inorder to explain the inconsistencies
          in thomson's model.
          <br> He held that:
          <li>Electrons move round the nucleus in certain stable orbits without emitting
            radiation.</li>
          <li>A definite amount of energy is attributed to each stable orbit.</li>
          <li>Electrons emit or absorb radiation in discrete packets when jumping from
            one orbit to another.</li>
          <br>Thus bohr's model could solve the stability problem (electrons collapsing
          into the atom) since it held that electrons do not emit radiation (are
          stable) when moving round the nucleus.
          <br>The next slide explains this more...→

        <h1>Bohr's model of the Atom</h1>
        <div class="main">
          Instead of having one orbit, bohr's model suggest many orbits denoted by n.
          <li>Each orbit has a specific energy requirement (energy levels)</li>
          <li>Energy levels are discrete that is can only be integers,n=1,2,3... and
            hence there are no in-between states like 1.5,2.5...</li>
          <li>Just like the rungs of a ladder</li>
          <li>In moving from a lower energy level say n=1,to a higher level say n=2,
            energy is absorbed by the lectron and is said to be excited</li>
          <li>This energy is absorbed in form of a photon (packet of e-m radiation)</li>
          <li>This energy is dependent on the the frequency of the photon and is given
            by
            <br>
            <h3 class="law">E=E<sub>n</sub>-E<sub>p</sub> = hf
              <br>E<sub>e</sub>= E<sub>p</sub>+ hf</h3>
            <br>E is energy absorbed (energy of the photon),E<sub>n</sub> is the energy
            of a higher orbit,E<sub>p</sub> is energy of the present orbit,h =
            6.626×10<sup>-34</sup>Js known as the planck constant and f is frequency
            of absorbed photon.</li>
          <li>In moving from a higher to a lower level energy is emitted in form of
            a photon.</li>
          <li>The orbit closest to the nucleus is known as the ground state and requires
            no absoption of energy. It is the most stable.</li>

          made upof protons and neutrons.
          <br> Protons are positively charged particles with a mass greater than that
          of electrons.
          <br> Neutrons are chargeless (neutral) and are heavier than electrons.
          <br>The number of protons and electrons in any neutral atom are equal in
          order to ensure neutrality.
          <br> The table below summarizes the specific properties of atomic building
          blocks.

        <div class="main">
          The composition of any atom can be conviniently represented using the following
          notation
          <span class="law"><sup >A</sup><sub class="sub">Z</sub>X</span>.
          A represents mass number. Z represents the atomic number.
          <br>Atomic number is the number of protons an atom contains.
          <br>Mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons in an atom.Thus:
          <h4 class="law">A = Z + N</h4>Where N is the number of neutrons. Thus the lithium atom
          drawn in the previous slide can be represented as <sup class="sup">5</sup><sub           class="sub">3</sub>Li. The mass number lithium (sum of protons and neutrons) is 5,
            the atomic number (proton) is 3. Number of neutrons:
            <br> N = A -Z = 5-3=2.
            <br> now try this one: give the number of basic constituents of <sup class="sup">4</sup>             <sub class="sub">2</sub>He.
